## Design for PyTorch Implementation of K-Factors Family

### Core Architecture

I'd design this as a modular system with clear separation between the algorithmic components that vary across methods and the shared infrastructure.

### Base Classes and Interfaces

**1. Abstract Base Clustering Algorithm**
- Defines the common interface: `fit()`, `predict()`, `fit_predict()`
- Handles convergence checking, iteration counting, logging
- Manages the alternating optimization loop structure
- Provides hooks for assignment and update steps

**2. Cluster Representation Interface**
- Abstract representation of what defines a cluster
- Methods: `distance_to_point()`, `update_from_points()`, `get_parameters()`
- Implementations: Centroid, Subspace, FactorModel

**3. Assignment Strategy Interface**
- Handles how points are assigned to clusters
- Methods: `compute_assignments()`, `compute_responsibilities()`
- Implementations: HardAssignment, SoftAssignment, PenalizedAssignment

### Component Library

**1. Cluster Representations**
- `CentroidRep`: Just stores mean (K-means)
- `SubspaceRep`: Mean + orthonormal basis vectors
- `PPCARep`: Mean + factor loadings W + noise variance σ²
- `FullGaussianRep`: Mean + full covariance

**2. Distance/Cost Computations**
- `EuclideanDistance`: ||x - μ||²
- `OrthogonalDistance`: ||(I - VV^T)(x - μ)||²
- `MahalanobisDistance`: (x-μ)^T Σ^(-1) (x-μ)
- `PenalizedResidualCost`: Includes claimed direction penalty

**3. Parameter Updates**
- `MeanUpdater`: Simple averaging
- `PCAUpdater`: SVD-based subspace extraction
- `SequentialPCAUpdater`: Residual-based sequential extraction
- `EMUpdater`: Soft-weighted updates for parameters

**4. Assignment Mechanisms**
- `NearestAssigner`: Hard assignment to closest cluster
- `ResponsibilityAssigner`: Soft assignments via posterior probabilities
- `SequentialAssigner`: K-Factors style with penalty tracking

### Data Structures

**1. ClusterState**
- Stores all parameters for each cluster
- Tracks assignment history if needed
- Provides efficient batch operations

**2. AssignmentMatrix**
- Sparse or dense representation of point-to-cluster assignments
- Supports both hard (binary) and soft (probabilistic) assignments
- Methods for efficient aggregation operations

**3. DirectionTracker** (K-Factors specific)
- Tracks claimed directions per point
- Efficient penalty computation
- Memory-efficient storage for large datasets

### Key Design Patterns

**1. Strategy Pattern**
- Assignment strategies and update strategies as pluggable components
- Allows mixing and matching (e.g., hard assignment with PCA update)

**2. Template Method**
- Base algorithm defines the skeleton (initialize, iterate, converge)
- Subclasses fill in specific steps

**3. Builder Pattern**
- Fluent interface to construct different algorithm variants
- Example: `ClusteringBuilder().with_k(10).with_hard_assignment().with_subspace_dim(3).build()`

**4. Visitor Pattern**
- For computing various metrics and diagnostics across different representations

### Optimization Considerations

**1. Batch Operations**
- All distance computations should support batched tensor operations
- Leverage PyTorch's broadcasting for efficiency

**2. Memory Management**
- Lazy allocation for optional components (e.g., covariance matrices)
- In-place operations where possible
- Option to use half-precision for large datasets

**3. GPU Acceleration**
- Ensure all core operations are GPU-compatible
- Manage device placement transparently
- Support multi-GPU for very large datasets

**4. Numerical Stability**
- Careful handling of eigendecompositions
- Regularization options for singular cases
- Log-space computations for responsibilities

### Configuration System

**1. Algorithm Configuration**
- Number of clusters, dimensions, iterations
- Convergence criteria
- Initialization strategies

**2. Computational Configuration**
- Device placement
- Precision settings
- Parallelization options

**3. Logging and Monitoring**
- Pluggable metrics computation
- Visualization hooks
- Checkpoint/resume functionality

### Extension Points

**1. Custom Initializations**
- K-means++, random, from previous solution
- Spectral initialization for subspace methods

**2. Constraints**
- Orthogonality constraints
- Sparsity constraints
- Must-link/cannot-link constraints

**3. Regularization**
- L2 regularization on parameters
- Entropy regularization for soft assignments
- Smoothness constraints on subspaces

This design would allow implementing the entire family (K-means, Fuzzy C-means, K-Lines, K-Subspaces, K-Factors, C-Factors, GMM) by combining appropriate components, while sharing the vast majority of infrastructure code.

# Applications of K-Factors and C-Factors

This document outlines practical domains where **K-Factors** (hard-assignment sequential PPCA) and its soft counterpart **C-Factors** (Mixture of PPCA) can be effectively applied.

## 1. Neural Network Weight Initialization

* **First-layer basis filters:** Use the learned local bases (K-Factors) on raw inputs or patches to initialize convolutional or fully connected layers, accelerating convergence and improving generalization.
* **Feature transfer:** Precomputed bases act as data-driven priors, reducing the burden on random initialization.

## 2. Data Compression & Dimensionality Reduction

* **Piecewise linear encoding:** Represent each data point by its projection coefficients onto its cluster’s basis, plus cluster ID.
* **Rate–distortion trade-off:** Control the number of clusters $K$ and subspace dimension $R$ to adjust compression ratio vs. reconstruction error.

## 3. Dictionary Learning & Sparse Coding

* **Hard K-SVD style:** Treat each claimed direction as an atom; each point selects one atom per iteration, akin to matching pursuit.
* **Initialization for sparse methods:** Use K-Factors output to seed overcomplete dictionaries before fine-tuning with L1-based sparse coding.

## 4. Piecewise Linear Manifold Learning

* **Local PCA patches:** Fit local subspaces for manifold approximation in high-dimensional data (e.g. images, sensor measurements).
* **Nonlinear embedding:** Combine cluster assignments and local coordinates to derive global nonlinear embeddings (e.g. via Locally Linear Embedding enhancements).

## 5. Anomaly & Outlier Detection

* **Subspace residuals:** Points with large residual error to all cluster bases indicate anomalies.
* **Sequential detection:** Early iterations flag coarse anomalies; deeper dimensions refine detection of subtle outliers.

## 6. Semi-Supervised & Transfer Learning

* **Cluster-informed labels:** Use cluster assignments or latent coordinates as features for downstream classifiers when labels are scarce.
* **Domain adaptation:** Learn local bases on source domain, adapt bases or reassign in target domain for improved transfer.

## 7. Denoising & Reconstruction

* **Noise filtering:** Reconstruct each point from its projection onto the learned subspace basis, discarding orthogonal noise.
* **Iterative refinement:** Increase $R$ to recover finer signal details, or adjust $K$ to capture more homogeneous noise characteristics.

**These applications leverage** the combination of clustering and sequential subspace learning to provide interpretable, efficient, and data-driven bases for a wide range of tasks.
